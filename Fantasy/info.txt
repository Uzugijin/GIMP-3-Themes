Fantasy theme for GIMP 2.99/3 made by Uzugijin (I don't really consider it finished, and light variant is janky, but feel free to modify, re-iterate, share and all that stuff)
goes to \GIMP 2.99\share\gimp\2.99\themes\

gimp.css = light theme colors, image references
gimp-dark.css = dark theme colors, image references
shared-settings.css = general gtk settings

"ui" folder contains all the images in use which can be overwritten, but filenames must remain the same, (or update any change in the "gimp~.css" files)
